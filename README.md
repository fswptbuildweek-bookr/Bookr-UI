## Project Bookr

Bookr is a project created for Lambda School Full Stack Web pilot's part-time build week. It involves members from across 4 cohorts coming together and putting the skills that we have learned to built a finished application with a marketing website. 


### Marketing Website

Created with HTML, CSS/LESS/Bulma and JavaScript. Website includes a homepage with information about application and features. Also a about page that lists team members and some of their contributions to project.
